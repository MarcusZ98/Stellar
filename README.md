# Stellar  

A Puzzle/Adventure Game Made in Unreal Engine 5  

## Overview  
*Stellar* is a puzzle-adventure game about Stella — a star who has fallen from the sky. On her journey to find her way back home, she meets a friendly alpaca companion and together they explore a calm, atmospheric world filled with puzzles and challenges.

This project was developed during the spring of 2024. It was created by a team of 8 students and served as my first introduction to Unreal Engine 5, Blueprints, and integrating them with C++ for most of us.

## About the Project
